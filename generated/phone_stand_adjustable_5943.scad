// OpenSCAD model: Design task: A phone stand with adjustable angle that can hold a tablet or smartphone (designed for 3D printing)

Purpose: Create a functional, manufacturable design for 3d printing.

Design considerations:

- Design for 3D printing with appropriate wall thickness (minimum 1.2mm)
- Avoid overhangs greater than 45Â° without supports
- Add fillets to stress points (min 0.5mm radius) and sharp corners
- Consider print orientation in the design

Implementation requirements:
- Use a fully parametric approach with all dimensions as variables
- Include clear comments explaining design decisions
- Organize code with logical module hierarchy
- Use appropriate OpenSCAD features efficiently

The previous code had issues: Variable 'angle' used before declaration
Please fix and regenerate focusing on manufacturability, clean syntax, and best practices.

```OpenSCAD
// Import necessary libraries
use <Round-Anything/polyround.scad>;
use <BOSL2/std.scad>;

// Parameters
$fn = 100; // For smooth curves
base_thickness = 3; // mm, thickness of the base for stability
back_thickness = 2; // mm, thickness of the back support
support_height = 120; // mm, height of the back support
support_width = 80; // mm, width of the back support suitable for phones and tablets
angle_min = 15; // degrees, minimum angle of inclination
angle_max = 75; // degrees, maximum angle of inclination
angle_step = 5; // degrees, step for angle adjustment
slot_depth = 10; // mm, depth of the slot to hold the device
slot_width = 15; // mm, width of the slot to accommodate devices with or without cases
fillet_radius = 1; // mm, radius for fillets to reduce stress concentration

// Main module
module phone_stand() {
    union() {
        base();
        adjustable_support()
}
}

// Base module
module base() {
    difference() {
        // Base plate with fillets for stress relief
        polyround(rect=[support_width + 2 * base_thickness, support_height / 2, base_thickness], r=fillet_radius);
        // Slot for the support to slide and adjust angle
        translate([base_thickness, support_height / 4, 0])
        cube([support_width, slot_depth, base_thickness + 1], center=true)
}
}

// Adjustable support module
module adjustable_support() {
    for (angle = [angle_min : angle_step : angle_max]) {
        rotate([0, angle, 0])
        translate([0, -support_height / 2, base_thickness])
        difference() {
            // Back support with fillets
            polyround(rect=[support_width, support_height, back_thickness], r=fillet_radius);
            // Cutout for the device
            translate([0, support_height / 2 - slot_depth, -1])
            cube([slot_width, slot_depth, back_thickness + 2], center=true)
}
    }
}

// Render the phone stand
phone_stand();
```

This OpenSCAD code defines a fully parametric, adjustable phone stand suitable for 3D printing. It includes a base and an adjustable support that can be positioned at various angles. The design uses fillets to reduce stress concentrations and is designed with a minimum wall thickness for printability. The adjustable support features a slot to hold a device, accommodating different sizes and cases. The code structure is organized into modules for clarity and reusability, and it uses libraries for rounded shapes and standard operations.
