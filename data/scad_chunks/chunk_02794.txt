// PointForExternal
// ----------------
// This function calculates the shared external tangent point
// of two circles.
// The calculation is based on similar triangles
// and calculations with vectors in OpenSCAD.
// It even works with overlapping circles.
// Parameters: 
//   Two circles.
//     Defined by their center points and radius.
// Return: 
//   A point in 2D
// Limits:
//   When both circles have the same radius, then the
//   common external point can not be calculated.
//   In that case, this function returns "inf" numbers 
//   with or without sign as in [±inf,±inf].
//   The "inf" number in OpenSCAD can be used in calculations.
//   When the same circle is used twice, then [nan,nan] is returned.
