/// Function: _adendum()
/// Usage:
///   ad = _adendum(circ_pitch, [profile_shift]);
///   ad = _adendum(diam_pitch=, [profile_shift=]);
///   ad = _adendum(mod=, [profile_shift=]);
/// Topics: Gears
/// Description:
///   The height of the top of a gear tooth above the pitch radius circle.
/// Arguments:
///   circ_pitch = The circular pitch, the distance between teeth centers around the pitch circle.
///   profile_shift = Profile shift factor x.  Default: 0 
///   ---
///   diam_pitch = The diametral pitch, or number of teeth per inch of pitch diameter.  The diametral pitch is a completely different thing than the pitch diameter.
///   mod = The module of the gear (pitch diameter / teeth)
/// Example:
///   ad = _adendum(circ_pitch=5);
///   ad = _adendum(mod=2);
/// Example(2D):
///   circ_pitch = 5; teeth = 17;
///   pr = pitch_radius(circ_pitch, teeth);
///   adn = _adendum(circ_pitch=5);
///   #spur_gear2d(circ_pitch=circ_pitch, teeth=teeth);
///   color("black") {
///       stroke(circle(r=pr),width=0.1,closed=true);
///       stroke(circle(r=pr+adn),width=0.1,closed=true);
///   }
