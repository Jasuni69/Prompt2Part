function pitch_radius(mm_per_tooth=5, number_of_teeth=11) =
	mm_per_tooth * number_of_teeth / PI / 2;


// Function: outer_radius()
// Description:
//   Calculates the outer radius for the gear. The gear fits entirely within a cylinder of this radius.
// Arguments:
//   mm_per_tooth = Distance between teeth around the pitch circle, in mm.
//   number of teeth = The number of teeth on the gear.
//   clearance = If given, sets the clearance between meshing teeth.
//   interior = If true, calculate for an interior gear.
