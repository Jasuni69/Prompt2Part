/// Internal Function: _slice_3dpolygons()
/// Usage:
///   splitpolys = _slice_3dpolygons(polys, dir, cuts);
/// Topics: Geometry, Polygons, Intersections
/// Description:
///   Given a list of 3D polygons, a choice of X, Y, or Z, and a cut list, `cuts`, splits all of the polygons where they cross
///   X/Y/Z at any value given in cuts.
/// Arguments:
///   polys = A list of 3D polygons to split.
///   dir_ind = slice direction, 0=X, 1=Y, or 2=Z
///   cuts = A list of scalar values for locating the cuts
