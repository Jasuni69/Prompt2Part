// Function: transform_desc()
// Synopsis: Applies a transformation matrix to a description
// Topics: Descriptions, Attachments
// See Also: parent()
// Usage:
//   new_desc = transform_desc(T, desc);
// Description:
//   Applies a transformation matrix to a description, producing a new transformed description as
//   output.  The transformation matrix can be produced using any of the usual transform commands.
//   The resulting description is as if it was produced from an object that had the transformation
//   applied.  You can also give a list of transformation matrices, in which case the output is
//   a list of descriptions.  
// Arguments:
//   T = transformation or list of transformations to apply (a 4x4 matrix or list of them)
//   desc = description to transform
