//!# NopSCADlib
//! An ever expanding library of parts modelled in OpenSCAD useful for 3D printers and enclosures for electronics, etc.
//!
//! It contains lots of vitamins (the RepRap term for non-printed parts), some general purpose printed parts and some utilities.
//! There are also Python scripts to generate Bills of Materials (BOMs),
//! STL files for all the printed parts, DXF files for CNC routed parts in a project and a manual containing assembly
//! instructions and exploded views by scraping markdown embedded in OpenSCAD comments, [see scripts](scripts/readme.md).
//!
//! A simple example project can be found [here](examples/MainsBreakOutBox/readme.md) and more complex examples [here](examples).
//!
//! For more examples of what it can make see the [gallery](gallery/readme.md).
//!
//! The license is GNU General Public License v3.0, see [COPYING](COPYING).
//!
//! See [usage](docs/usage.md) for requirements, installation instructions and a usage guide.
//!
//! A list of changes classified as breaking, additions or fixes is maintained in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
//!
