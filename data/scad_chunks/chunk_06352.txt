/// Internal Function: _is_at_left()
/// Usage:
///   pt = point_left_of_line2d(point, line);
/// Topics: Geometry, Points, Lines
/// Description:
///   Return true iff a 2d point is on or at left of the line defined by `line`.
/// Arguments:
///   pt = The 2d point to check position of.
///   line  = Array of two 2d points forming the line segment to test against.
///   eps = Tolerance in the geometrical tests.
