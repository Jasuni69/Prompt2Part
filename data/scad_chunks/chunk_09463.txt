// Function: distance_from_plane()
// Usage:
//   distance_from_plane(plane, point)
// Description:
//   Given a plane as [A,B,C,D] where the cartesian equation for that plane
//   is Ax+By+Cz+D=0, determines how far from that plane the given point is.
//   The returned distance will be positive if the point is in front of the
//   plane; on the same side of the plane as the normal of that plane points
//   towards.  If the point is behind the plane, then the distance returned
//   will be negative.  The normal of the plane is the same as [A,B,C].
// Arguments:
//   plane = The [A,B,C,D] values for the equation of the plane.
//   point = The point to test.
