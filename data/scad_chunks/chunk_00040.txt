// This generates a closed polyhedron from an array of arrays of points,
// with each inner array tracing out one loop outlining the polyhedron.
// pointarrays should contain an array of N arrays each of size P outlining a
// closed manifold.  The points must obey the right-hand rule.  For example,
// looking down, the P points in the inner arrays are counter-clockwise in a
// loop, while the N point arrays increase in height.  Points in each inner
// array do not need to be equal height, but they usually should not meet or
// cross the line segments from the adjacent points in the other arrays.
// (N>=2, P>=3)
// Core triangles:
//   [j][i], [j+1][i], [j+1][(i+1)%P]
//   [j][i], [j+1][(i+1)%P], [j][(i+1)%P]
//   Then triangles are formed in a loop with the middle point of the first
//   and last array.
