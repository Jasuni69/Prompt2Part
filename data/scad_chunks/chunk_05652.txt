// Function: worm_dist()
// Synopsis: Returns the distance between a worm and a worm gear
// Topics: Gears, Parts
// See Also: worm(), worm_gear(), pitch_radius(), outer_radius()
// Usage:
//   dist = worm_dist(mod=|diam_pitch=|circ_pitch=, d, starts, teeth, [profile_shift], [pressure_angle=]);
// Description:
//   Calculate the distance between the centers of a worm and its mating worm gear, taking account
//   possible profile shifting of the worm gear.
// Arguments:
//   d = diameter of worm
//   starts = number of starts of worm
//   teeth = number of teeth on worm gear
//   profile_shift = profile shift of worm gear
//   ---
//   mod = The module of the gear (pitch diameter / teeth)
//   diam_pitch = The diametral pitch, or number of teeth per inch of pitch diameter.  The diametral pitch is a completely different thing than the pitch diameter.
//   circ_pitch = The circular pitch, the distance between teeth centers around the pitch circle.
//   pressure_angle = The pressure angle of the gear.
//   backlash = Add extra space to produce a total of 2*backlash between the two gears.
