// Double Fillet generates a path that is a smooth transition between two parallel surfaces
// h is the vertical distance between surfaces, negative height will mirror about the vertical axis
// r1 and r2 are the first and second fillet radius traversing away from origin
// xoffset1 distance from origin where first radius begins ( should be >= 0 )
// xoffset2 distance from edge of first radius to the start of second radius.  0 value makes straight wall, < 0 makes overhang
// closed = true will return a closed polygon ready for extrusion, 
//    while cloesd == false returns a just the curved vertex path that can be use as part of a larger path
