//  will be a 3D point except when the input is a 2D point and rotation is only along the Z axis

//  pts      (list)   List of zero or more 2D or 3D points.
//  angles   (list)   angles along X, Y and Z axis in that order. Angles in degrees.
//  z_offset (number) moves the final z value by Z-offset.
//  return   (list)   Rotated list of 3D points.
