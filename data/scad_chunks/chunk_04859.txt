//  function _pb_forward(last, args, rel, angle)
//
//  Adds a point some distance along in the same direction as the last line segment or last angle.
//  The distance depends on the arguments provided. Extends last line to intersect with one or multiple reference lines described by the provided parameters.
//  The function will not add points if the last line is parallel with the reference line(s) or when it doesn't satisfy the bounds_mode rules.
//  last    (list)  The point list being constructed.
//  rel     (bool)  Set to false when working with relative boundary values. Set to true when working with absolute boundary values.
//  args    (list)  Function specific parameters.
//      args[0]  If a single value is provided the last line segment is extended with that value.
//  angle   (number)  Last known angle.
//  If two values are provided the last line is extended to wich ever line is intersected with first either the line with the value x or reference lines are assumed to lie parallel with both x and y axis. Two values provide a reference line points are given the intersection with that line.
