// Computes the points of a continuous curvature roundover given as input
// the list of 3 points defining the corner and a parameter specification
//
// If parm is a scalar then it is treated as the curvature and the control
// points are calculated using _smooth_bez_fill.  Otherwise, parm is assumed
// to be a pair [d,k] where d is the length of the curve.  The length is
// calculated from the input point list and the control point list does not
// necessarily include points[0] or points[2] on its output.
//
// The number of points output is $fn if it is set.  Otherwise $fs is used
// to calculate the point count.
