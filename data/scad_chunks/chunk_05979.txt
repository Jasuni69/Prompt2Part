/// Function: _hex_offsets()
/// Usage:
///   _hex_offsets(n, d)
/// Description:
///   Returns the centerpoints for the optimal hexagonal packing
///   of at least `n` circular items, of diameter `d`.  Will return
///   enough points to fill out the last ring, even if that is more
///   than `n` points.
/// Arguments:
///   n = Number of items to bundle.
///   d = How far to space each point away from others.
