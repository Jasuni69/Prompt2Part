//! 1. Put the blue wire from the IEC inlet through the bottom left jack hole, strip it, add heatshrink sleeving and solder it to one of the blue jack sockets.
//! 1. Put the green & yellow wire through the top left jack hole, add heatshrink sleeving and solder it to one of the green jack sockets.
//! 1. Put the thin brown wire the bottom right jack hole, add heatshrink sleeving and solder it to the brown jack socket.
//! 1. Shrink the heatshrink and screw in the three jack sockets.
//! 1. Solder a 13A green & yellow wire to the remaining green jack socket, long enough to reach the 13A socket. Add heashrink and fit it to the top right jack hole.
//! 1. Solder a 13A blue wire to the remaining blue jack socket, long enough to reach the 13A socket. Add heatshrink and fit to the bottom middle jack hole.
//! 1. Crimp appropriate ferrules to the three wires and connect them to the 13A socket.
//! 1. Screw the socket onto the top of the case using two 20mm M3 countersunk cap screws.
