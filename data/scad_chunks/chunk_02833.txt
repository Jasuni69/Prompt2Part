// RandomNonOverlap
// ----------------
// Randomly Distribute Shapes Over An Area Without Overlap.
// Goal: To make a birthday card or Christmas card 
//       with many small shapes, randomly distributed,
//       without overlapping other shapes.
//       The shapes can be, for example, stars or 
//       hearts or balloons.
// A random coordinate is added to the list if it was
// not too close to the other coordinates.
// Parameters:
//   n:    The number of coordinates.
//         The result might have less coordinates,
//         because the coordinates that are too close
//         will not be used.
//         For example 10 or 100.
//   area: The size as [xsize,ysize] for the area.
//         The lower-left corner is at [0,0].
//   dist: The minimal distance between the coordinates.
//   list: Used internally to build the result.
