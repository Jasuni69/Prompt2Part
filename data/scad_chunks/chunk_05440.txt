// Section: Attachable Descriptions for Operating on Attachables or Restoring a Previous State

// Function: parent()
// Topics: Transforms, Attachments, Descriptions
// See Also: restore()
// Synopsis: Returns a description (transformation state and attachment geometry) of the parent
// Usage:
//   PARENT() let( desc = parent() ) CHILDREN;
// Usage: in development releases only
//   PARENT() { desc=parent(); CHILDREN; }
// Description:
//   Returns a description of the closest attachable ancestor in the geometry tree, along with the current transformation.  You can use this
//   description to create new objects based on the described object or perform computations based on the described object.  You can also use it to
//   restore the context of the parent object and transformation state using {{restore()}}.  Note that with OpenSCAD 2021.01 you need to use `let` for
//   this function to work, and the definition of the variable is scoped to the children of the let module.
//   (In development versions the use of let is no longer necessary.)  Note that if OpenSCAD displays any warnings
//   related to transformation operations then the transformation that parent() returns is likely to be incorrect, even if OpenSCAD
//   continues to run and produces a valid result.
