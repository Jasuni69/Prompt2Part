/// Internal Function: _vnf_centroid()
/// Usage:
///   vol = _vnf_centroid(vnf);
/// Description:
///   Returns the centroid of the given manifold VNF.  The VNF must describe a valid polyhedron with consistent face direction and
///   no holes; otherwise the results are undefined.

/// Divide the solid up into tetrahedra with the origin as one vertex.
/// The centroid of a tetrahedron is the average of its vertices.
/// The centroid of the total is the volume weighted average.
