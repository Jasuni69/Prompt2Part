// Extract vertex mapping from offset face list.  The output of this function
// is a list of pairs [i,j] where i is an index into the parent curve and j is
// an index into the offset curve.  It would probably make sense to rewrite
// offset() to return this instead of the face list and have offset_sweep
// use this input to assemble the faces it needs.
