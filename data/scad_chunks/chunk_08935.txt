function wall_gyroid(x, y, z, w)=
	let(n=grad_gyroid(x, y, z))				    	// calculate the gardient of the gyroid function pointing to the wall vector
	[x, y, z] + w * n / ( 2 * norm(n));				// normalize gradient and multipy it with half of the wall thickness

// Calculates points of a triangular part of a gyroid surface with edge points [0,0], [0,180] and [90,90].
// All other points can be derived from these points by means of coodinate ransformation. The points are calculated in the form of 
// a grid having pp lines in x direction and 2*pp rows in y direction. Additionally one line / row is calculated byond said limits,
// to smoothly combine the individual parts by union().
// pp=number of rows
// w=wall thickness
