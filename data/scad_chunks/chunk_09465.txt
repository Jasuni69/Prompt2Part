	abs(distance_from_plane(plane, point)) <= EPSILON;


// Function: in_front_of_plane()
// Usage:
//   in_front_of_plane(plane, point);
// Description:
//   Given a plane as [A,B,C,D] where the cartesian equation for that plane
//   is Ax+By+Cz+D=0, determines if the given point is on the side of that
//   plane that the normal points towards.  The normal of the plane is the
//   same as [A,B,C].
// Arguments:
//   plane = The [A,B,C,D] values for the equation of the plane.
//   point = The point to test.
