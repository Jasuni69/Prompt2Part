/// Internal Function: _path_select()
/// Usage:
///   _path_select(path,s1,u1,s2,u2,[closed]):
/// Description:
///   Returns a portion of a path, from between the `u1` part of segment `s1`, to the `u2` part of
///   segment `s2`.  Both `u1` and `u2` are values between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive, where 0 is the start
///   of the segment, and 1 is the end.  Both `s1` and `s2` are integers, where 0 is the first segment.
/// Arguments:
///   path = The path to get a section of.
///   s1 = The number of the starting segment.
///   u1 = The proportion along the starting segment, between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.
///   s2 = The number of the ending segment.
///   u2 = The proportion along the ending segment, between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.
///   closed = If true, treat path as a closed polygon.
