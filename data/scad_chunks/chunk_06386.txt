/// Internal Function: is_point_above_plane()
/// Usage:
///   bool = _is_point_above_plane(plane, point);
/// Topics: Geometry, Planes
/// Description:
///   Given a plane as [A,B,C,D] where the cartesian equation for that plane
///   is Ax+By+Cz=D, determines if the given 3D point is on the side of that
///   plane that the normal points toward.  The normal of the plane is the
///   same as [A,B,C].
/// Arguments:
///   plane = The [A,B,C,D] coefficients for the first plane equation `Ax+By+Cz=D`.
///   point = The 3D point to test.
